# Traffic Light Control with PPO

This project implements a traffic light control environment using reinforcement learning. The environment simulates traffic at an intersection, where the goal is to manage traffic lights and minimize the number of cars waiting at the intersection. The model is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm from `stable-baselines3`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `stable-baselines3`
- `gymnasium`
- `numpy`
- `tensorboard`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install stable-baselines3 gymnasium numpy tensorboard
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic_light_ppo.git
cd traffic_light_ppo
```

## Usage

### Running the Code

1. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python env.py
    ```

2. Monitor training in TensorBoard:
    ```bash
    tensorboard --logdir=./ppo_traffic_tensorboard/
    ```

### Main Script: `main.py`

The main script trains the traffic light environment using PPO. It includes the following steps:

1. Environment initialization.
2. Training the PPO model for 10,000 timesteps.
3. Running the trained model and rendering the traffic intersection.

## Environment

The environment simulates an intersection with traffic lights and two roads: north-south (NS) and east-west (EW). The agent controls the traffic light, which can either be green for NS or EW. The goal of the agent is to minimize the total number of cars at the intersection by controlling the traffic light appropriately.

- **Action space**: Discrete actions:
  - `0`: Green for NS, Red for EW.
  - `1`: Red for NS, Green for EW.

- **Observation space**: A 2D vector representing the number of cars waiting on the NS and EW roads.
  - `obs[0]`: Number of cars on NS road.
  - `obs[1]`: Number of cars on EW road.

- **Reward**: The negative sum of cars on both roads. The goal is to minimize the number of cars.

### Example Environment Code

```python
import gymnasium as gym
from gymnasium import spaces
import numpy as np

class TrafficIntersectionEnv(gym.Env):
    # Environment initialization and setup
    def __init__(self):
        ...
        
    # Reset environment at the start of an episode
    def reset(self, seed=None, options=None):
        ...

    # Step function: apply action and update environment
    def step(self, action):
        ...
        
    # Render the current state
    def render(self, mode='human'):
        ...
```

## Training

The agent is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. The training process involves learning a policy to minimize traffic congestion by dynamically switching traffic lights.

```python
from stable_baselines3 import PPO

# Initialize PPO model
model = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1, tensorboard_log="./ppo_traffic_tensorboard/")

# Train model for 10,000 timesteps
model.learn(total_timesteps=10000, tb_log_name="PPO_traffic_light")
```

Metrics like KL divergence, entropy, and value loss are important for assessing the performance and convergence of the PPO algorithm.
